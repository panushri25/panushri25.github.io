# Biography

I am Anusri Pampari. I am a graduate student in computer science at UIUC. My research interests are focused in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Working as a member of Professor Jian Pengâ€™s group, I  have been leading a collaborative project with IBM Research. My work so far has been focused on developing a question answering system for Electronic Medical Records. In this endeavor, we developed a large dataset "emrQA", and I am happy to be presenting this work at EMNLP, 2018's main conference in Brussels, Belgium. This work also introduced me to the important and challenging problem of machine learning interpretability, which is the focus of my ongoing research.
